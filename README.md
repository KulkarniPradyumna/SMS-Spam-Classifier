# SMS-Spam-Classifier

<strong>Overview</strong>
This repository contains code for a spam classifier built using the NLTK library and the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm. The classifier is designed to differentiate between spam and non-spam (ham) messages with high accuracy.

<strong>Dataset</strong>
The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and ham messages. The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set for model evaluation.

<strong>Requirements</strong>
Python 3.x
NLTK library

<strong>To install the required libraries, use the following command:</strong>
pip install nltk

<strong>How to Use</strong>
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
Run the SpamClassifier.ipynb script.
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the text data, and train the Naive Bayes classifier.
After training, the script will evaluate the classifier's performance on the testing set.
The accuracy score of the classifier will be displayed on the console, which should be approximately 96%.

<strong>Customization</strong>
You can modify the SpamClassifier.ipynb script to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, or even try out other machine learning algorithms for classification.


<strong>Acknowledgments</strong>
The development of this spam classifier is inspired by the excellent resources provided by the NLTK library and the vast community support for machine learning enthusiasts.
